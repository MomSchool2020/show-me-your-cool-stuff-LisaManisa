# Day 1

# Challenge 1: Make a program that prints a message to the screen.
# Challenge 2: Ask the user what they want to print, and put their answer in a variable. Print whatever is in the variable.
# Challenge 3: After asking what to print, ask how many times to print it. Store this in a variable, and don't do anything with it for now.
# Challenge 4: Check if they asked to print it 0 times. If they did, print a message to the screen to tell them.
# Challenge 5: Check if the thing they typed is a number. You may need to google how to do this. If it isn't, tell them.
# Challenge 6: In both steps 4 and 5, instead of printing a message, create an error. You might need to google how to do this.

# Do as many of these challenges as you can.
